ECS140_Lisp
===========

First time writing in LISP. 
-----
the file that we write. the output matches depending on what size the window is. need to be the default putty/unix size. 
ONLY supposed to use PURE LISP functions, except for some of them. Not allowed to use SETQ... etc.

functions include: 
- double-recursive(y) - recursively double list elements 
- double-iterative(y) - iteratively double list elements
- double-mapcar(y) - use map car to double the lists
- rdouble(y) - recursively go into lists and make double
- my-mapcar(fun l1 l2) - perform mapcar functions without using mapcar
- rewrite(x) - we are rewriting some lisp code to PURE lisp. 
- check(x) - we check the output of our rewrite function and the output of the real values of the function given.

double-recursive, double-iterative, and double-mapcar should output the same things.
